<p>Up until now, we've considered only lists whose contents are fixed and
unchanging, that is, <dfn>static</dfn> (see <a href="Glossary.html#static">static</a>) lists.  But in real programs, many
lists are <dfn>dynamic</dfn> (see <a href="Glossary.html#dynamic">dynamic</a>), with their contents changing rapidly and
unpredictably.  For the case of dynamic lists, we need to reconsider
some of the attributes of the types of lists that we've
examined.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p>Specifically, we want to know how long it takes to insert a new element
into a list and to remove an existing element from a list.  Think about
it for each type of list examined so far:

<!-- FIXME: Dann Corbit: -->
<!-- Mention heaps, skip lists, hash tables. -->
<dl>
<dt><b>Unordered array</b><dd>
Adding items to the list is easy and fast, unless the array grows too
large for the block and has to be copied into a new area of memory. Just
copy the new item to the end of the list and increase the size by one.

     <p>Removing an item from the list is almost as simple. If the item to
delete happens to be located at the very end of the array, just reduce
the size of the list by one. If it's located at any other spot, you must
also copy the element that is located at the very end onto the location
that the deleted element used to occupy.

     <br><dt><b>Ordered array</b><dd>
In terms of inserting and removing elements, ordered arrays are
mechanically the same as unordered arrays.  The difference is that
insertions and deletions can only be at one end of the array if the item
in question is the largest or smallest in the list.  The practical
upshot is that dynamic ordered arrays are only efficient if items are
added and removed in sorted order.

     <br><dt><b>Binary search tree</b><dd>
Insertions and deletions are where binary search trees have their chance
to shine.  Insertions and deletions are efficient in binary search trees
whether they're made at the beginning, middle, or end of the lists. 
</dl>

   <p>Clearly, binary search trees are superior to ordered or unordered arrays
in situations that require insertion and deletion in random positions. 
But insertion and deletion operations in binary search trees require a
bit of explanation if you've never seen them before.  This is what the
next chapter is for, so read on.
