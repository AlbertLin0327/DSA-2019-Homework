<p>This book contains all the source code to libavl.  Conversely, much
of the source code presented in this book is part of libavl.

   <p>libavl is written in ANSI/ISO C89 using TexiWEB, a <dfn>literate
programming</dfn> (see <a href="Glossary.html#literate%20programming">literate programming</a>) system.  Literate programming is a philosophy that regards
software as a kind of literature.  The ideas behind literate programming
have been around for a long time, but the term itself was invented by
computer scientist Donald Knuth in 1984, who wrote two of his most
famous programs (TeX and METAFONT) with a literate programming system of
his own design.  That system, called <tt>WEB</tt>, inspired the form and much
of the syntax of TexiWEB.

   <p>A TexiWEB document is a C program that has been cut into sections,
rearranged, and annotated, with the goal to make the program as a whole
as comprehensible as possible to a reader who starts at the beginning
and reads the entire program in order.  Of course, understanding large,
complex programs cannot be trivial, but TexiWEB tries to make it as
easy as possible.

   <p>Each section of a TexiWEB program is assigned both a number and a
name.  Section numbers are assigned sequentially, starting from 1 with
the first section, and they are used for cross-references between
sections.  Section names are words or phrases assigned by the TexiWEB
program's author to describe the role of the section's code.

   <p>Here's a sample TexiWEB section:

<pre class="format">19. &lt;Clear hash table entries 19&gt; =
<b>for</b><!-- /@w --> (<i>i</i><!-- /@w --> = 0; <i>i</i><!-- /@w --> &lt; <i>hash</i><!-- /@w -->-&gt;<i>m</i><!-- /@w -->; <i>i</i><!-- /@w -->++)
  <i>hash</i><!-- /@w -->-&gt;<i>entry</i><!-- /@w -->[<i>i</i><!-- /@w -->] = <tt>NULL</tt><!-- /@w -->;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><small>This code is included in 15.</small>

   <p>The first line of a section, as shown here, gives the section's name and
its number within angle brackets. 
The section number is also given at the left margin to make individual
sections easy to find.

   <p>In TexiWEB, C's reserved words are shown like this: <b>int</b><!-- /@w -->, <b>struct</b><!-- /@w -->,
<b>while</b><!-- /@w --><small class="enddots">....</small> Types defined with <b>typedef</b><!-- /@w --> or with <b>struct</b><!-- /@w -->,
<b>union</b><!-- /@w -->, and <b>enum</b><!-- /@w --> tags are shown the same way.  Identifiers in all
capital letters (often names of macros) are shown like this: <tt>BUFSIZ</tt><!-- /@w -->,
<tt>EOF</tt><!-- /@w -->, <tt>ERANGE</tt><!-- /@w --><small class="enddots">....</small> Other identifiers are shown like this: <i>getc</i><!-- /@w -->,
<i>argv</i><!-- /@w -->, <i>strlen</i><!-- /@w --><small class="enddots">....</small>

   <p>Code segments often contain references to other code segments, shown as
a section name and number within angle brackets.  These act something
like macros, in that they stand for the corresponding replacement text. 
For instance, consider the following segment:

<pre class="format">15. &lt;Initialize hash table 15&gt; =
<i>hash</i><!-- /@w -->-&gt;<i>m</i><!-- /@w --> = 13;
&lt;Clear hash table entries 19&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><small>See also 16.</small>

   <p>This means that the code for `Clear hash table entries' should be
inserted as part of `Initialize hash table'.  Because the name of a
section explains what it does, it's often unnecessary to know anything
more.  If you do want more detail, the section number <small>19</small> in
&lt;<a href="Sequential-Search-of-Ordered-Array-with-Sentinel.html#19">Clear hash table entries 19</a>&gt; can easily be used to find the
full text and annotations for `Clear hash table entries'. 
You can also view the fully expanded code in a code segment by
following the link from the segment name or number (our example does
not include this feature). 
At the bottom of section 19 you will find a note reading `<small>This
code is included in 15.</small>', making it easy to move back to
section 15 that includes it.

   <p>There's also a note following the code in the section above:
`<small>See also 16.</small>'.  This demonstrates how TexiWEB
handles multiple sections that have the same name.  When a name that
corresponds to multiple sections is referenced, code from all the
sections with that name is substituted, in order of appearance.  The
first section with the name ends with a note listing the numbers of
all other same-named sections.  Later sections show their own numbers
in the left margin, but the number of the first section within angle
brackets, to make the first section easy to find.  For example, here's
another line of code for &lt;<a href="Table-Headers.html#15">Clear hash table entries 15</a>&gt;:

<pre class="format">16. &lt;Initialize hash table 15&gt; +=
<i>hash</i><!-- /@w -->-&gt;<i>n</i><!-- /@w --> = 0;
</pre>
   <p>Code segment references have one more feature: the ability to do special
macro replacements within the referenced code.  These replacements are
made on all words within the code segment referenced and recursively
within code segments that the segment references, and so on.  Word
prefixes as well as full words are replaced, as are even occurrences
within comments in the referenced code.  Replacements take place
regardless of case, and the case of the replacement mirrors the case of
the replaced text. This odd feature is useful for adapting a section of
code written for one library having a particular identifier prefix for
use in a different library with another identifier prefix.  For
instance, the reference `&lt;BST types; bst =&gt;
avl&gt;' inserts the contents of the segment named `BST types',
replacing `bst' by `avl' wherever the former appears at the beginning of
a word.

   <p>When a TexiWEB program is converted to C, conversion conceptually
begins from sections named for files; e.g., &lt;<span class="file">foo.c</span>
37&gt;.  Within these sections, all section references
are expanded, then references within those sections are expanded, and so
on.  When expansion is complete, the specified files are written out.

   <p>A final resource in reading a TexiWEB is the index, which contains an
entry for the points of declaration of every section name, function,
type, structure, union, global variable, and macro.  Declarations within
functions are not indexed.
