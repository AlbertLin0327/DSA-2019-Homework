<p>In an ordinary binary search tree or balanced tree, a lot of the pointer
fields go more-or-less unused.  Instead of pointing to somewhere useful,
they are used to store null pointers.  In a sense, they're wasted.  What
if we were to instead use these fields to point elsewhere in the tree?

   <p>This is the idea behind a threaded tree.  In a threaded tree, a node's
left child pointer field, if it would otherwise be a null pointer, is
used to point to the node's inorder predecessor.  An otherwise-null
right child pointer field points to the node's successor.  The
least-valued node in a threaded tree has a null pointer for its left
thread, and the greatest-valued node similarly has a null right
thread.  These two are the only null pointers in a threaded tree.

   <p>Here's a sample threaded tree:

<div align="center"><a href="tbst1.txt"><img border=0 src="tbst1.png" alt="[Click here for plain-text rendering]"></a></div>

<p class="noindent">This diagram illustrates the convention used for threads in
this book, arrowheads attached to dotted lines.  Null threads in the
least and greatest nodes are shown as arrows pointing into space. 
This kind of arrow is also used to show threads that point to nodes
not shown in the diagram.

   <p>There are some disadvantages to threaded trees.  Each node in an
unthreaded tree has only one pointer that leads to it, either from the
tree structure or its parent node, but in a threaded tree some nodes
have as many as three pointers leading to them: one from the root or
parent, one from its predecessor's right thread, and one from its
successor's left thread.  This means that, although traversing a
threaded tree is simpler, building and maintaining a threaded tree is
more complicated.

   <p>As we learned earlier, any node that has a right child has a successor
in its right subtree, and that successor has no left child.  So, a
node in an threaded tree has a left thread pointing back to it if and
only if the node has a right child.  Similarly, a node has a right
thread pointing to it if and only if the node has a left child.  Take
a look at the sample tree above and check these statements for
yourself for some of its nodes.
