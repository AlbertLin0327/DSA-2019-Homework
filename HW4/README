The first argument of tree_predictor.cpp is the test (prediction) data in the format same as training data, and the output 
is the accuray of the predictor on the test data.
For example, 
	./tree_predictor heart

Usage of the Makefile.ta:
1. make -f Makefile.ta run_tree FNAME=heart.train EPS=3 :
   run the decision tree on data heart.train with epsilon = 3.
2. make -f Makefile.ta predict_tree PNAME=heart.test :
   make prediction by the decision tree model on data heart.test .

You can play around with different FNAME, PNAME and EPS.
